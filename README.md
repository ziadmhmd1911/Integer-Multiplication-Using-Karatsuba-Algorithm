# Integer-Multiplication-Using-Karatsuba-Algorithm
Given TWO LARGE positive integers of N digits/each. Each integer is stored in 1D array. Implement an efficient algorithm based on Karatsuba’s method to multiply them?

NOTES:
• N is power of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32… 2^i)
• Result MUST be stored in 2×N digits (left padded by 0’s if necessary)
• Least significant digit is stored at index 0 while most significant is stored at index N-1)

Complexity
The complexity of your algorithm should be less than O(N^2)
